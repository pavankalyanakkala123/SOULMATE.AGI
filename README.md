## Problem Statement / Use Case
Design and implement a personalized AGI-powered digital companion that evolves with user interactions, offering emotional support, memory recall, and adaptive intelligence through cloud-based training.

## Abstract / Problem Description
SoulMate.AGI is an AI-native, user-trained general intelligence system that builds its personality, preferences, tone, and knowledge base directly from the user’s daily interactions. It starts with a foundation LLM or multimodal model and evolves through fine-tuning, embedding learning, and cloud-based incremental updates. Daily user interactions (text, voice, or video) are used to incrementally train the model overnight, helping it become a mirror of the user’s emotional and personal needs over time.


Tech Stack:
-----------
- Python + Streamlit (Frontend)
- GPT / LLM (base conversational intelligence)
- Sentence Transformers + FAISS (vector memory)
- DeepFace + OpenCV (emotion detection)
- Cryptography (Fernet encryption)
- LoRA Simulation (self-evolving nightly fine-tuning)


## Project Explanation
SoulMate.AGI functions as a lifelong evolving AI companion. Throughout the day, users interact with the system via conversations or journaling. Every night, the model undergoes training on collected data to enhance emotional intelligence and memory. It uses facial sentiment detection, emotional journaling, and memory recall to offer therapeutic insights. Over time, it forms a long-term memory vault and adapts its tone and responses to match the user’s mood, preferences, and personal growth needs. The final goal is to make AI feel human by aligning it deeply with individual users.
